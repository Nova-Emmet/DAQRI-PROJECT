# DAQRI-PROJECT
A list of scripts I used with a DAQRI Smart Helmet project. 

These are just samples of the scripts. No assets or project files are included.

Controller.cs is used to control the flow of the app. You navigate the UI elements, take as screenshot, generate a PDF report and 
have the option of resetting the project or quitting at the end.
